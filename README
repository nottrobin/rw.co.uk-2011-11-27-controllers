Web controllers
===

Contained herein are web controller written in different languages.

At the time of writing, only the following two languages are used:
 - PHP
 - NodeJS

And I have only written controller for robinwinslow.co.uk.

Both controllers are currently setup to read from the same json-templates files,
which can be set at the top of node_sites/robinwinslow.co.uk.js
and php_sites/robinwinslow.co.uk.php respectively.

These json-template files are located in my "robinwinslow.co.uk" repository:
https://nottrobin@github.com/nottrobin/robinwinslow.co.uk.git

This demonstrates an absolute separation of view (json templates)
from controller.

Note that while node_server.js can be run independently as an actual server
which will listen on http://127.0.0.1:8081 (`node node_server.js`)
php_controller.php is only a controller and must be run from a dedicated server
either directly or as a FastCGI process.

NB: I would recommend that you still use another server to proxy to node_server.js.
    I use nginx
